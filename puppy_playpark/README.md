# Puppy Playpark

A simulation game that allows you to interact with three dogs—**Toto**, **Solaire**, **and Pogs**. It allows you to do certain actions with the friendly canines such as feed, play, and let them bark.

This is a small project I made when I was studying the basics of **Object Oriented Programming in Python**.
